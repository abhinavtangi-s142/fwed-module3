# Professional Portfolio — Abhinav Tangi

A lightweight, accessible, responsive front-end portfolio template showcasing projects, skills, and contact information. Built with semantic HTML, minimal CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Ideal for personal use, demoing UI work, and as a starting point for portfolio customizations.

## Features
- Responsive hero/profile layout and project grid
- Contact form with client-side validation
- Accessible markup (landmarks, ARIA labels, keyboard-first links)
- Simple, production-ready static site (no build step required)
- Ready to deploy to GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify, etc.

## Project structure (recommended for submission)
- index.html
- css/
    - style.css         ← move inline or embedded styles here
- js/
    - script.js            ← move site scripts (form handling, year update) here
- images/
    - profile.jpg
    - project-1.png
    - project-2.png
    - ...
- README.md

> Note: The provided index.html is self-contained for preview. For a production submission, extract CSS and JS into the structure above and update paths.

## Getting started / Preview locally
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Quick preview: open `index.html` in a browser.
3. Recommended (serves files over HTTP):
     - Python 3: `python3 -m http.server 8000` then visit `http://localhost:8000`
     - Node (serve): `npx serve .` then visit the shown URL

## Customization
- Replace placeholder images in `images/` and update `src` attributes.
- Update text, project links, and contact info in `index.html`.
- Extract and extend CSS in `css/styles.css` (use CSS variables and utility classes).
- Move inline scripts to `js/main.js` and include with `defer`.

## Accessibility & Best Practices
- Use semantic headings and landmarks for screen-reader navigation.
- Ensure meaningful alt text for images.
- Keep color contrast and focus outlines for keyboard users.
- Validate the contact form inputs and optionally integrate a serverless form backend (Formspree, Netlify Forms, etc.) for production messaging.

## Deployment
- Push to a Git branch and deploy to:
    - GitHub Pages — repository → Settings → Pages
    - Vercel — import repo and deploy
    - Netlify — drag & drop or connect repo
No build step required for static deployment.
